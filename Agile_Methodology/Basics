The agile model is an iterative & incremental approach of developing software.
- Iterative -  The same process is repeated again & again i.e Requirement collection, Design, coding & Testing.
- Incremental - After every iteration, new modules will be added.

Principles
================
Customer satisfaction is of the highest priority, the customer no need to wait for a long time for software, and a piece of software will be delivered in an incremental manner.
Requirement changes are accepted in between the software development

Advantages
=================
Requirement changes can be accommodated in the middle of the development.
Releases will be fast.

Disadvantages
======================
Less focus on design & documentation since we need to deliver the software fastly.

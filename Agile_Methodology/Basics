It is one of the SDLC modles

The agile model is an iterative & incremental approach of developing software.
- Iterative -  The same process is repeated again & again in iterations i.e Requirement collection & analysis, Design, coding & Testing.
- Incremental - After every iteration, new modules will be added to the software.

Principles
================
- Customer satisfaction is of the highest priority, the customer no need to wait for a long time for software, a piece of software will be delivered in an incremental manner.
- Requirement changes are accepted anytime in between the software development

Advantages
=================
Requirement changes can be accommodated in the middle of the development.
The customer no need to wait for a long time for software, a piece of software will be delivered in an incremental manner.

Disadvantages
======================
Less focus on design & documentation since multiple releases will be there.

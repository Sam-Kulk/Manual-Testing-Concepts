Levels of testing with respect to the validation

White box(Done by developers in development setup)
----------------------------------------------------
1. Unit testing
2. Integration

Black-Box(Done by testers in testing setup)
----------------------------------------------
3. System
4. UAT

1. UNIT TESTING
================
- Unit is basically a single module in a software.
Ex : Login, Inbox, Deleted items, Sent items etc..
- I can consider it as a single file in project structure
- So unit testing is basically testing the individual modules of a software with different inputs.

2. INTEGRATION TESTING
=============================
- Testing the data flow between 2 or more modules of the software is called as Integration testing
Ex: Login --> Inbox --> Sent Items, Sent Items --> Deleted Items, Deleted Items --> Sent Items , Deleted Items --> Inbox, etc..

Note :
1. These scenarios are tested by testers from UI as a part of system testing
2. Here two approaches are followed top-down & bottom-up i.e. top-down - parent to child module data-flow & vice versa.

3. SYSTEM TESTING
======================
- Testing the overall application with respect to the actual requirements.
- It involves testing of both the Functional & Non Functional aspects of the application.

4. UAT(User Acceptance Testing)
===================================
- Customer/Client will come up with his own testcases with respect to the requirements given by him on the software.
- Customer/Client will test the application with the help of dev & testing team.
- After UAT Customer/Client will accept/deny the application.

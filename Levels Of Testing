1. UNIT TESTING
================
- Unit is basically a single module in a software.
Ex : Login, Inbox, Deleted items, Sent items etc..
- I can consider it as a single file in project structure
- So unit testing is basically testing the individual modules of a software i.e features in an individual module

2. INTEGRATION TESTING
=============================
- Testing the data flow between 2 or more modules of the software is called as Integration testing
Ex: Inbox --> Sent Items, Sent Items --> Deleted Items, Deleted Items --> Sent Items , Deleted Items --> Inbox, etc..

3. SYSTEM TESTING
======================
- Testing the overall functionalities of the application with respect to the actual requirements.
- It is done on actual software/application.
- It requires through knowledge of the requirements
- It involves different types of testing i.e. Functional, Non Functional etc..


4. UAT
=============
- Customer/Client will come up with his own testcases with respect to the requirements given by him on the software.
- Customer/Client will test the application with the help of dev & testing team usually on production setup.
- After UAT Customer/Client will accept/deny the application.

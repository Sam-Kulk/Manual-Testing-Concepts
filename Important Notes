Verification v/s Validation
==============================
Verification
-------------
- It involves testing the project related documents i.e. requirement(BRD, SRS & FSD) & design(HLD & LLD) documents.
- It is done before the development stage.
- Testing is done by inspection, review & walkthrough
- Verification is done to ensure that we are building the right product.
- It is known as static testing.

Note:
---------
Review : It means to test the correctness & completeness of the document.

Validation
----------
- It involves testing the application developed.
- It is done after the development stage
- Testing done is in the form of Unit & Integration(Dev), System(QA) & UAT(Client, QA & others)
- Validation is done to check whether we have built product right.
- It is known as Dynamic testing.

BRD, SRS & FSD
=================
BRD(Business Requirement Document)
---------------------------------
- It basically defines what the company's business wants to achieve through the project i.e. it basically defines the high-level business objectives/goals of company with respect to project.
- It primarily includes
    1. Problem statement and the expected benefits from the project.
    2. Project objectives & scope
    3. High-level features/functionalities of application.
- It is prepared by Business Analyst/Client

SRS(Software Requirements Specification)
------------------------------------------
- It basically defines how the software should behave.
- It primarily includes
    1. High level description of application functionalities & it's usecases.
    2. High level Functional & Non-Functional requirements of application.
- It is prepared by Project Manager & used by Dev & Testing team.

FSD(Functional Specification Document)/FRS(Functional Requirement Specification)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- It is basically sub-set of SRS & it basically focuses on the functional aspects of the application in detail.
- It primarily includes
    - detailed description of the each & every functionality
    - detailed description of the data flow between different modules of the application.
- It is prepared by Project Manager & used by Dev & Testing team.

BLACK BOX V/S WHITE BOX TESTING
===================================
White-Box testing
-----------------------
- White-Box testing is a activity that basically involves testing the source code(logics & integration) that is written for the application
- White-Box testing requires the understanding of the code logic & structure
- Developers will be doing the White-Box testing
- Unit & Integration testing comes under this.

Black-Box testing
---------------------
- Black-Box testing is a activity that basically involves testing the software application
according to it's requirements without looking into the source code from users perspective
- Black-Box testing requires the knowledge of the software application requirements.
- Black-Box testing will be done by testers
- System & UAT testing comes under this.

QA V/S QC
============
QA - Quality Assurance
-------------------------
- It involves defining the std process & ensuring that it is followed by the team, so as to prevent defects in software.
- It is process oriented
- Management team(dev, testing, support & others team) will be involved in QA.

QC - Quality Control
-------------------------
- It involves testing the actual development as per the requirements to find defects.
- It is product oriented
- Testers will be involved in the QC

SE V/S QE
============
Software Engineer(SE) is one who writes code to develop software.

neer(QE) is one who writes the code/script to test the software i.e. automation tester.

Broken Links
==============
A broken link is a link that doest have the target page.

Cookies and Sessions
===================
Cookie
------------
- It is a temporary file created by browser while browsing webpage.
- It is added in the browser side itself.
- It stores some kind of data i.e login credentials, search history, active time etc.
Ex : Login to gmail, amazon search & ads on other webpages.

Session
-------
- It is basically a timeslot created on server side for max user's idle time on webpage.
- The timeslot will get expired after sometime.
- Mainly found in banking applications.
- User need to re-login, once the session expires.
Ex: EPFO session expired


Defect Severity V/S Priority
===============================
Severity
----------
It indicates how much impact does the defect has on end-users usage of the application's core/basic functionality i.e. Critical, Major or Minor

Priority
-----------
It indicates the priority for fixing the defect i.e. High, Medium or Low.
It usually needs to be decided by dev/QA.

Low Severity & High priority : Messaging app carshes when user tries to send some specific uncommly used emoji, payment website crashes when user input an invalid A/C number
High Severity & Low prioirty : Spelling mistakes, Misallignment of some elenemts on web page, indicates poor ui-ux design of software.

Escape Defect
=================
The defect that is missed by testing team & found by customers/others.

Principles of testing
========================
- Start early i.e. when we get the requirements not after build is given i.e. we should start atleast authoring phase.
- Keep updating the test cases to find the new defects. Pesticide Paradox
- Highly impossible to give bug free software to customer.

Release notes
==============
- Release notes for a build basically contains the information about the new changes & fixes provided in the build.
- It contains steps to install the build & information of dependiences required.

HLD & LLD
==============
HLD(High Level Design)
-----------------------
- It will show the high level architecture of the software system i.e. it will show the various components & modules of the software & their interactions on high level.
- It is nothing but the overview of the software's architecture.
- It is prepared by PM.

LLD
----
- It will show the detailed architecture of the software system i.e. it will show the various components & modules of the software & their interactions in detailed way.
- Developers will use LLD for software development.
- It is prepared by PM.

Note : Both LLD & HLD will be a diagrams

Imp points
==================
- Whenever we get a new build : smoke ,retest of bugs raised in previous build, sanity to check the impact of the bug fixes & changes & then regression testing is done.

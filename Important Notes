Verification v/s Validation
==============================
Verification
-------------
- Verification is checking whether we are building the right product
- It is done before the development stage.
- It basically involves requirement & design documentation testing(Static testing)
- Testing is done by inspection, review & walkthrough

Validation
----------
- Validation is checking whether we have built product right
- It is done after the development stage
- It involves testing the software(Dynamic testing)
- Testing done is Unit & Integration(Dev), System(QA) & UAT(Client, QA & others)


BLACK BOX V/S WHITE BOX TESTING
===================================
White-Box testing
-----------------------
- White-Box testing is a activity that basically involves testing the source code(logics & integration) that is written for the application
- White-Box testing requires the understanding of the code logic & structure
- Developers will be doing the White-Box testing
- Unit & Integration i.e. static testing comes under this.

Black-Box testing
---------------------
- Black-Box testing is a activity that basically involves testing the software application
according to it's requirements without looking into the source code from users perspective
- Black-Box testing requires the knowledge of the software application requirements
- Black-Box testing will be done by testers
- System & UAT i.e. dynamic testing comes under this.


QA V/S QC
============
QA - Quality Assurance
-------------------------
- It involves defining the process & ensuring that it is followed so as to prevent defects in software.
- It is process orinented
- Management team(dev, testing, support & others team) will be involved in QA.

QC - Quality Control
-------------------------
- It involves testing the actual software to detect defects
- It is product oriented
- Testers will be involved in the QC
- QC comes under QA

The various stages through which the defect/bug has to pass through during it's life cycle is called as DLC.

The stages involved are
- Defect Identification
- Raising of the defect & assignment to relevant person, here the defect will be in TO DO state.
- Defect analysis by developer, where he can accept/reject the defect i.e. IN_PROGRESS/REJECTED.
- Defect fixiation & status will be 'Verifycation'
- Retesting of defect, where TE retests the defect & if it is fixed, then it will be closed i.e. DONE & else it will be reopened i.e. TO DO.

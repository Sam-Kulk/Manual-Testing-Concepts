The test design techniques are used to prepare the test data, here the objective will be to prepare the minimal test data, with which the functionality/component can be tested properly.

Types
==========
1. Boundary Value Analysis(BVA)
===============================
- Used for preparing the test data for input fields accepting a range of data.
- Here each boundary of the range is tested with 3 values.

Example 1 : If 18-35 is range of values accepted by input field, then test data will be

Min(18) - valid
Min-1(17) - invalid
Min+1(19) - valid
Max(35) - valid
Max-1(34) - valid
Max+1(36) - invalid

Example 2 : x>50
49,50 & 51

2.Equivalence Class Partitioning(ECP)
=========================================
1-500 ==> 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500

3. Error Guessing
=======================
In this tester based on his experience & intuition guesses or identifyies the areas or scenarios in which software may have defects, write test cases accordingly & test

4. Decision Table

5. State Transition

Note : BVA & Error Guessing are the one which are generally used in real-time.

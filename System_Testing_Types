1. GUI(Graphical User Interface) TESTING
==============================================
It involves basically testing the
- Presence of the required web-elements.
- Positions, size, font & colours of different web-elements
- It also includes testing the correctness of the different texts on the web-elements i.e. placeholders, dropdown options, text on buttons etc..

2. USABILITY TESTING
=========================
Testing the user-friendliness of the software i.e. testing how easily the user is able to understand and use the application.

Application should have below to be user friendly.
- applications should be easy to understand.
- help menu
- smooth user interactions/actions
- minimal inputs from user
- easy & clear navigation between the pages

3. FUNCTIONAL TESTING
========================
Testing the different functionalities/features present in the application.
Functional testing is done is two ends.

Frontend
----------------
- CRED operations(Read is done by filter and search)
- Field Validation
- Web-Elements properties/attributes testing i.e. enabled/disabled, selected/unselected etc..
- Login & other application specific functionalities(for example calculate percentage based on marks provided).

- Database testing i.e. Grey Box testing which involves performing the DML(Create, Update and Delete) operations, it is done to check whether the proper communication is happening or not between GUI and Db. opeations are performed on db & checked in GUI.
- Functionality testing using server logs

4. NON-FUNCTIONAL TESTING
===========================
- Once the application functionalities are stable, then Non-Functional testing is done i.e. after doing the functional testing.
- It includes Performance, Security, Installation, Recovery & Compatibility etc..
